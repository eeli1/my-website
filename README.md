## this repository is for building my website

run the python script `python3 script.py` to build a static website in the `build` diretory 

then go in that directory `cd build` and then start a simple webserver e.g. `python3 -m http.server`

or just run the `./build.sh` and then go to [`http://localhost:8000/`](http://localhost:8000/)

if you want to host the website just copy the content of the `build` directory to the webserver
